# Input-rate-encoding-and-gain-control-in-dendrites-
This repository contains the code from Matlab and IgorPro environments that generates a simple input rate to voltage output model of branch integration.

These files in this repository can be used to recreate Figures 7 and 8 of "Input rate encoding and gain control in dendrites of neocortical pyramidal neurons" by Nikolai C. Dembrow and William J. Spain, as well as simulate how temporal patterns of input onto a single branch will be transformed into voltage.
